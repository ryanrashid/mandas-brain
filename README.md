# mandas-brain
A simple web application requested by Amanda to help her make daily life decisions without having to think too hard. Given a set of options, it randomly chooses one of them and displays it in fancy text! This project isn't that educational, but at least its fun.

Visit the site by clicking [here](https://ryanrashid.github.io/mandas-brain/), or typing https://ryanrashid.github.io/mandas-brain/ into a web browser.

## Home Page
Right away, the app asks the user to make a decision about the number of options to choose from. The upper limit is six, because if you're choosing between seven or more options, you might have bigger problems on your hands.

In the upper left corner, the 'oops' emoji acts as a home button if you find yourself making a mistake during this complicated process. After clicking the button for the number of choices, the Options Page will appear.

## Options Page
Depending on the number of options selected, a set of option fields will be displayed. Input the situations, actions, thoughts, etc. you're choosing between, and click the button to let the computer decide for you.

**Two Options**

However, if you're unsatisfied with the decision chosen for you, click the angry emoji in the bottom right to re-roll the dice for a different option.
