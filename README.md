# mandas-brain
A simple web application requested by Amanda to help her make daily life decisions without having to think too hard. Given a set of options, it randomly chooses one of them and displays it in fancy text! This project isn't super educational, but at least its fun.

## Home Page
Right away, the app asks the user to make a decision about how many options there are to choose from. The upper limit is six, because if you're choosing between seven or more options, you might have bigger problems in your hands.

In the upper left corner, the 'Oops' emoji acts as a home button if you find yourself accidentally messing up during the process of automating your decisions. After clicking the button for the number of options, the Options Page will appear.

## Options Page
Depending on the number of options selected, a set of option fields will be displayed. Input the options you're choosing between, and click the button to let the computer decide which one you should do.

**Two Options**

## Final Decision Page
The page will display the chosen option in large bright font. However, if you're unsatisfied with the decision chosen for you, click the angry emoji in the bottom right to re-roll the dice for a different option.
