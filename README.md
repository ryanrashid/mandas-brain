# mandas-brain
A simple web application requested by Amanda to help her make daily life decisions without having to think too hard. Given a set of options, it randomly chooses one of them and displays it in fancy text! This project isn't super educational, but at least its fun.

## Home Page
Right away, the app asks the user to make a decision about how many options there are to choose from. The upper limit is six, because if you're choosing between seven or more options, you might have bigger problems in your hands.

In the upper left corner, the 'Oops' emoji acts as a home button if you find yourself accidentally messing up during the process of automating your decisions. After clicking the button for the number of options, the Options Page will appear.
